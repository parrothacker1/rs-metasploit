The experiment about using a custom return type is a success
For more details check the main.rs file .. as u can see the 
auth.login returns result and token but i am able to take out 
token only .. if i do not know the return type i can use 
rmpv::Value.

And also i can use gitpod Docker for running metasploit ..
No need to install anywhere .. just need an github account ...

Command= docker run -it -p 4040:5553 -d metasploit

That's all ... retunr and complete the code ...
